**Marrakech Telecom Customer Churn Prediction App with Python and Gradio**

![Alt text](<Gradio App.png>)
 
Customer churn is a major problem for many businesses, especially in the telecom industry, where customers can easily switch to other providers. Customer churn can lead to loss of revenue, market share, and customer loyalty. Therefore, it is important for telecom companies to identify the customers who are likely to churn and take proactive actions to retain them.
One way to do this is to use machine learning to build a predictive model that can analyze the customer data and output the probability of churn for each customer. This can help the telecom company to segment the customers based on their churn risk and design targeted marketing campaigns or offer incentives to reduce the churn rate.

We will use a random forest classifier to train our model and then use Gradio to create a user-friendly app that can take user inputs and output the predicted churn status of the customer.

**Step 1: Import necessary libraries**
First, we imported some libraries that we will use for our project. We will use Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation, re and os for regular expressions and file operations, pickle for saving and loading objects, sklearn for machine learning, and gradio for creating the app interface
 

**Step 2: Load the machine learning toolkit**
Next, we loaded the machine learning toolkit that contains some preprocessed items that we will use for our model. 
 
**Step 3: Define a function to process and predict**
Now after loaded our machine learning toolkit, we defined a function that can takes user inputs and return the predicted churn status of the customer.

**Step 4: Create the app interface**
Finally, we used Gradio to create the app interface that will allow users to interact with our model.

 **Gradio App Deployment**

There are different ways to deploy a Gradio app, depending on your preferences and needs. Here are some of the most common methods:
1.	You can use the share parameter in the launch() method to generate a public, shareable link that you can send to anyone. For example, you can write app.launch (share=True) to create a link like XXXXX.gradio.app. This method is easy and convenient, but the link will expire after 72 hours and anyone can access it. Also, the processing will happen on your device, so you need to keep it on and connected to the internet. (This is the one that we used.)
2.	You can use Hugging Face Spaces to host your Gradio app for free and get a permanent link. You can either use the Gradio CLI (gradio deploy) in your app directory, drag and drop your app folder on the Spaces website, or connect Spaces with your Git repository. This method is more secure and reliable, but you need to create a Hugging Face account and follow some steps to deploy your app
3.	You can use your own web server or cloud service provider (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) to host your Gradio app. You can either use Docker to create a containerized app or use Nginx to configure a reverse proxy for your app. This method gives you more control and flexibility, but you need to have some technical skills and pay for the hosting service.
